# Claude Code Graph A/B Testing Guide

## 🎯 **Objective Metrics for Social Media**

### Test Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone test repository
git clone https://github.com/vercel/next.js.git
cd next.js

# 2. Initialize graphs  
ccg init
ccg daemon start

# 3. Start A/B test session
ccg start
```

## 📊 **Test Scenarios & Commands**

### **Scenario 1: Find Authentication Files**
**Objective**: Measure tool calls needed to find auth-related code

**Normal Claude Code:**
```
User: "Find all files related to authentication in this codebase"
Expected: 8-15 tool calls (broad Grep searches, multiple Read operations)
```

**Graph-Enhanced Claude Code:**
```  
User: "Find all files related to authentication in this codebase"
Expected: 3-5 tool calls (graph analysis, targeted reads)
```

**Measurement**: Count tool calls in Claude's trace before getting complete answer

---

### **Scenario 2: Understanding Component Dependencies**
**Objective**: Speed and accuracy of dependency discovery

**Normal Claude Code:**
```
User: "Show me what files depend on the Button component"
Expected: Multiple grep operations, manual file browsing
```

**Graph-Enhanced Claude Code:**
```
User: "Show me what files depend on the Button component"  
Expected: Single graph query with immediate relationships
```

**Commands to verify:**
- `/find-related packages/next/client/components/Button.tsx`
- `/graph-overview` (architectural context)

---

### **Scenario 3: Impact Analysis**
**Objective**: Understanding change impact before making modifications

**Normal Claude Code:**
```
User: "What would break if I modify the routing system?"
Expected: Text searches, educated guessing
```

**Graph-Enhanced Claude Code:**
```
User: "What would break if I modify the routing system?"
Expected: Precise dependency tracing via graph relationships
```

**Commands to verify:**
- `/hot-paths` (find critical code paths)
- `/cycles` (identify circular dependencies)

---

### **Scenario 4: Architecture Overview**
**Objective**: Speed of codebase understanding for new developers

**Normal Claude Code:**
```
User: "Explain the architecture of this project" 
Expected: 10+ file reads, manual exploration
```

**Graph-Enhanced Claude Code:**
```
User: "Explain the architecture of this project"
Expected: Instant overview via graph analysis
```

**Commands to verify:**
- `/graph-overview` (instant architectural summary)
- `/graph-stats` (quantitative metrics)

---

## 🏆 **Success Metrics**

### **Quantitative (Twitter-worthy)**
- **Tool Calls Reduction**: 60-80% fewer tool calls per task
- **Time to Answer**: 3-5x faster for structural queries  
- **Accuracy**: 90%+ precision in file discovery vs 60% with text search
- **Context Efficiency**: Graph provides architectural context immediately

### **Sample Tweet Metrics**
```
🧠 Claude Code Graph Results:

Task: "Find authentication system files"
❌ Normal: 12 tool calls, 45 seconds  
✅ Graph: 3 tool calls, 8 seconds

Task: "What uses Component X?"
❌ Normal: 8 grep searches, manual filtering
✅ Graph: 1 relationship query, instant results

75% fewer tool calls, 80% faster 🚀
```

## 🎮 **Interactive Testing Session**

### **Live Demo Commands**
```bash
# 1. Show system status
ccg status

# 2. Display architectural overview  
# (Run in Claude Code session)
/graph-overview

# 3. Find specific relationships
/find-related packages/next/client/router.ts

# 4. Show hot paths
/hot-paths --limit=5

# 5. Check for circular dependencies
/cycles

# 6. Performance comparison
time grep -r "useRouter" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" 
# vs
/find-related packages/next/client/use-router.ts
```

---

## 📈 **Measurement Tools**

### **Tool Call Counter Script**
```javascript
// Add to Claude session for counting
let toolCallCount = 0;
const originalTool = window.callTool;
window.callTool = function(...args) {
    toolCallCount++;
    console.log(`Tool call #${toolCallCount}:`, args[0]);
    return originalTool.apply(this, args);
};

// Reset counter
toolCallCount = 0;
```

### **Performance Timer**
```bash
# Time graph operations
time ccg build

# Time daemon responsiveness
echo "test.js" > test.js && time ccg daemon status
```

---

## 🔄 **A/B Test Protocol**

1. **Control Group (Normal Claude Code)**: 
   - Use standard Claude Code without graph system
   - Record tool calls and time for each task

2. **Test Group (Graph-Enhanced)**:
   - Use claude-code-graph with daemon running
   - Record same metrics for identical tasks

3. **Comparison Metrics**:
   - Tool calls per task completion
   - Time to accurate answer
   - Precision of file discovery
   - Quality of architectural insights

4. **Document Results**:
   - Screenshots of tool traces
   - Timing data
   - Accuracy comparisons
   - User experience notes

## 🎯 **Ready-to-Tweet Results**

Expected improvements:
- **60-80% reduction** in tool calls
- **3-5x faster** structural queries
- **90%+ precision** in file discovery  
- **Instant architectural** context vs manual exploration

The graph intelligence transforms Claude from a powerful text processor into a **code architecture expert** that understands your entire system structure! 🧠⚡
