# Claude Code Graph: OpenSpiel Testing Guide

## üéØ **Why OpenSpiel is Perfect for Testing**

OpenSpiel is an ideal testbed because:
- **Massive C++ codebase**: ~500+ C++ files with complex game logic
- **Deep inheritance hierarchies**: Game classes, strategies, algorithms
- **Complex dependencies**: Each game implementation has intricate relationships
- **Poor discoverability**: Hard to find where specific game logic is implemented
- **Real-world problem**: You struggle with this codebase regularly

## üöÄ **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone and Initialize**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel.git
cd open_spiel
ccg init
```

### **2. Build Initial Graphs**
```bash
ccg build
ccg daemon start
```

### **3. Launch Graph-Enhanced Claude Code**
```bash
ccg start
```

## üß™ **A/B Testing Scenarios for OpenSpiel**

### **Scenario 1: Find Game Implementation**
**Challenge**: OpenSpiel has 70+ games, hard to find specific implementations

**Normal Claude Code:**
```
User: "Where is the Texas Hold'em poker implementation?"
Expected: 5-10 grep searches, browsing multiple directories
Result: Finds text matches but struggles with actual implementation files
```

**Graph-Enhanced Claude Code:**
```
User: "Where is the Texas Hold'em poker implementation?"
Expected: Graph analysis finds: open_spiel/games/texas_holdem/
Commands: /find-related texas_holdem or /graph-overview
Result: Direct path to implementation + related files
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Understanding Game Inheritance**
**Challenge**: Games inherit from SpielGame, State classes - complex hierarchy

**Normal Claude Code:**
```
User: "Show me all classes that inherit from SpielGame"
Expected: Multiple grep operations, manual analysis
Result: Scattered results, misses inheritance relationships  
```

**Graph-Enhanced Claude Code:**
```
User: "Show me all classes that inherit from SpielGame"
Expected: Graph traces inheritance relationships
Commands: /find-related spiel.h or /hot-paths
Result: Complete inheritance tree with confidence scores
```

---

### **Scenario 3: Algorithm Implementation Discovery**
**Challenge**: AI algorithms scattered across multiple directories

**Normal Claude Code:**
```
User: "Find all MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) implementations"
Expected: 8+ file searches, manual filtering
Result: Finds text mentions but misses actual algorithm files
```

**Graph-Enhanced Claude Code:**
```
User: "Find all MCTS implementations"  
Expected: Graph analysis of algorithm dependencies
Commands: /find-related mcts.h or /cycles
Result: Core MCTS + all game-specific implementations
```

---

### **Scenario 4: Build System Understanding**
**Challenge**: Complex CMake setup with many optional components

**Normal Claude Code:**
```
User: "What needs to be compiled to build poker games?"
Expected: Manual CMake file exploration, guesswork
Result: Incomplete dependency understanding
```

**Graph-Enhanced Claude Code:**
```
User: "What needs to be compiled to build poker games?"
Expected: Include graph traces compilation dependencies
Commands: /graph-overview ‚Üí shows build targets
Result: Complete dependency chain for poker games
```

---

## üìä **Expected Performance Improvements**

### **File Discovery Speed**
- **Normal**: 30-60 seconds to find specific game implementation
- **Graph**: 5-10 seconds with precise results

### **Relationship Understanding**
- **Normal**: Manual tracing through inheritance, often incomplete
- **Graph**: Instant inheritance/include graphs with full context

### **Architecture Comprehension**  
- **Normal**: Hours to understand game organization
- **Graph**: Minutes with `/graph-overview` + `/hot-paths`

## üéØ **Specific Test Commands**

### **Quick Architecture Understanding**
```bash
# In Claude Code Graph session:
/graph-overview                    # See overall structure
/hot-paths --limit=10             # Find most connected files  
/find-related open_spiel/spiel.h   # Core class relationships
/cycles                           # Check for problematic dependencies
```

### **Game Discovery Tests**
```bash
# Find specific games:
/find-related poker                # All poker variants
/find-related chess               # Chess implementation  
/find-related go                  # Go/Weiqi implementation

# Algorithm discovery:
/find-related mcts                # Monte Carlo Tree Search
/find-related minimax             # Minimax algorithm
/find-related neural_fictitious   # Neural Fictitious Play
```

### **Development Workflow Tests**
```bash
# Before modifying code:
/find-related spiel_game.h        # See what inherits from base
/hot-paths                        # Identify critical code paths
/cycles                          # Check for circular dependencies

# Impact analysis:
User: "What breaks if I modify the State class?"
Expected: Graph shows all State subclasses + dependencies
```

## üîß **Architecture Integration Details**

### **How Graph Intelligence Works in OpenSpiel**

1. **Static Context**: Claude always sees architectural overview
2. **Dynamic Tool Selection**: Graph guides file discovery
3. **Query Enhancement**: Structural questions use graph data
4. **Relationship Tracing**: Include graphs show dependencies

### **What Claude "Sees" with Graphs**
```
Before: Individual C++ files, scattered across directories
After: 
- Complete inheritance hierarchies
- Include dependency chains  
- Game implementation clusters
- Algorithm relationship maps
- Build system dependency trees
```

This transforms Claude from a **text search tool** into a **C++ architecture expert** that understands OpenSpiel's structure! üß†‚ö°
