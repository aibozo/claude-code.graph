## 🎯 **Query Processing Examples**

### **Example 1: "Find files related to GraphService"**

**Claude's Enhanced Process:**
1. **Graph Analysis**: Checks relationship data
2. **Smart Discovery**: Finds 4 directly related files + 2 dependent files
3. **Confidence Ranking**: Orders by relationship strength
4. **Tool Selection**: Uses targeted Read instead of broad Grep

**Result:**
```
High Confidence Results (Graph-Discovered):
✅ src/graph/GraphTool.js (imports GraphService, 95% confidence)
✅ src/index.js (exports GraphService, 90% confidence)  
✅ tests/integration/graph-integration.test.js (tests GraphService, 85% confidence)

Medium Confidence Results (Graph-Inferred):
⚡ src/graph/GraphCommands.js (uses via GraphTool, 70% confidence)
⚡ src/graph/PerformanceOptimizer.js (optimizes GraphService, 65% confidence)

Traditional Search Would Have Found: 47 files with "GraphService" text
Graph Search Found: 5 highly relevant files
```

### **Example 2: "Help me refactor the authentication system"**

**Without Graph:**
```
Claude searches for "auth" across codebase
Finds: auth.js, login.js, middleware.js, config.js, utils.js... (50+ files)
User manually sorts through results
```

**With Graph Intelligence:**
```yaml
Graph Analysis Results:
  Authentication Module Structure:
    Core Files:
      - src/auth/AuthService.js (central hub, 8 dependencies)
      - src/auth/LoginHandler.js (imports AuthService + crypto utils)
      - src/auth/middleware.js (imports AuthService, used by 12 routes)
    
    Dependencies:
      - src/utils/crypto.js (shared utility, 15 importers)
      - src/config/auth.yml (configuration, no code dependencies)
    
    Usage Analysis:
      - 12 API routes depend on auth middleware
      - 5 React components use AuthService
      - 3 background jobs require auth utilities
    
    Refactoring Recommendations:
      1. Start with AuthService.js (minimal dependencies)
      2. Update crypto.js (affects 15 files - run tests after)
      3. Modify middleware.js last (affects 12 routes)
    
    Impact Warning:
      Changing AuthService affects 25 files across the codebase
```

### **Example 3: "What would break if I delete this utility function?"**

**Graph-Powered Impact Analysis:**
```yaml
Function: hashPassword() in src/utils/crypto.js

Direct Callers (from call graph):
  - src/auth/LoginHandler.js:23
  - src/auth/PasswordReset.js:45  
  - tests/auth/crypto.test.js:12

Indirect Impact (from module graph):
  Files importing crypto.js:
    - src/auth/AuthService.js
    - src/background/UserSync.js
    - src/api/routes/auth.js
  
  Files that import those files:
    - src/index.js (imports AuthService)
    - src/api/server.js (imports auth routes)
    - 12 React components (use AuthService)

Total Impact: 18 files would be affected
Risk Level: HIGH (core utility function)
Recommendation: Add deprecation warning first, create migration plan
```

## 🔄 **Real-Time Context Updates**

### **As You Code (Daemon Running):**

```
User edits: src/auth/LoginHandler.js
├── Daemon detects change in 50ms
├── Updates call graph for auth module  
├── Refreshes relationship mappings
└── Claude gets updated context instantly

Next User Query: "Show me what uses LoginHandler"
├── Claude uses fresh graph data (updated 2 seconds ago)
├── Finds new relationships immediately  
└── Provides accurate, current results
```

### **Context Freshness Indicators:**
```yaml
Graph Status:
  Last Updated: 2 seconds ago
  Daemon: Running (PID 12345)
  Pending Updates: 0
  Context Confidence: 100% (all graphs current)
```

## 🧠 **Enhanced Tool Selection Logic**

### **Query Analysis Process:**

```javascript
// Example: "Find components that use the Button component"

1. Query Classification:
   - Structural: ✅ (looking for relationships)
   - Specific Target: ✅ ("Button component")
   - Scope: Limited (components only)

2. Graph Analysis:
   - Target Found: src/components/Button.jsx
   - Relationship Type: "imports" + "extends"
   - Related Files: 8 found

3. Strategy Selection:
   - Primary: Graph Search (8 targeted files)
   - Fallback: Grep within components/ directory
   - Confidence: 95%

4. Result:
   - Tool: Targeted Read (8 files)
   - Order: By relationship strength
   - Time: <100ms vs 5+ seconds for full grep
```

---

## 📈 **Performance Impact**

### **Before Graph Integration:**
```
Query: "Find files related to authentication"
├── Tool: Grep across entire codebase
├── Time: 3-8 seconds  
├── Results: 100+ files with "auth" mentions
├── Relevance: ~20% actually useful
└── User: Manual filtering required
```

### **After Graph Integration:**
```
Query: "Find files related to authentication"  
├── Tool: Graph relationship analysis
├── Time: <100ms
├── Results: 12 highly relevant files
├── Relevance: ~95% directly useful
└── User: Immediate actionable results
```

## 🎭 **Context Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: New Developer Onboarding**
```
Developer: "Help me understand this codebase"

Claude with Graph Context:
- Shows architectural overview from graph
- Identifies entry points and hot paths
- Explains module relationships visually
- Suggests exploration order based on dependencies

Result: 50% faster onboarding vs traditional file browsing
```

### **Scenario 2: Bug Investigation**
```
Developer: "This auth bug affects multiple areas, show me the impact"

Claude with Graph Context:
- Traces auth flow through call graph
- Identifies all affected modules  
- Shows test files related to auth
- Suggests debugging order by dependency chain

Result: Systematic investigation vs random file hunting
```

### **Scenario 3: Performance Optimization**
```
Developer: "What should I optimize first?"

Claude with Graph Context:
- Analyzes hot paths from graph data
- Identifies most-called functions
- Shows bottleneck dependencies
- Prioritizes optimization targets by impact

Result: Data-driven optimization vs guesswork
```

## 🔮 **The Magic: What This Enables**

With graph context, Claude Code becomes:

1. **🧭 Architectural Navigator** - Understands code structure, not just syntax
2. **🔗 Relationship Expert** - Knows what connects to what and why
3. **⚡ Performance Analyzer** - Identifies bottlenecks and optimization targets  
4. **🛡️ Impact Assessor** - Predicts consequences of changes before you make them
5. **🎯 Smart Assistant** - Provides contextually relevant suggestions

**The Result:** Claude Code transforms from a smart text processor into a true code intelligence platform that understands your entire system architecture.
