# Claude Code Graph - Complete Feature Set

## üéØ **What We've Built: Claude Code + Graph Intelligence**

Claude Code Graph transforms Claude Code from a powerful code assistant into a **graph-aware code intelligence system** that understands your entire codebase structure.

---

## üß† **Core Intelligence Enhancements**

### **1. Graph-Enhanced Tool Selection**
**Before:** Claude chooses between Read, Grep, Glob based on simple heuristics
**After:** Claude intelligently selects tools based on graph relationships

```
User: "Find all files related to authentication"

OLD APPROACH:
- Grep for "auth" across all files
- Returns 100+ matches, many irrelevant

NEW APPROACH:
- Graph analysis finds auth-related files through imports/calls
- Returns 12 highly relevant files in dependency order
- Suggests reading core auth files first
```

### **2. Context-Aware File Discovery** 
**Before:** Claude searches broadly through filesystem
**After:** Claude uses relationship graphs to find relevant files

```
User: "Show me what uses the Button component"

OLD: grep -r "Button" src/ (hundreds of results)
NEW: Graph shows 8 files that import Button + 3 files that extend it
```

### **3. Smart Search Prioritization**
**Before:** Search results in filesystem order
**After:** Search results ranked by graph importance and relationships

### **4. Architectural Understanding**
**Before:** Claude sees files individually 
**After:** Claude understands system architecture, hot paths, and dependencies

---

## üéØ **Integration Points with Claude Code**

### **1. Enhanced `.claude/code.yml` Configuration**

```yaml
# NEW: Graph-specific configuration
graph:
  enabled: true
  max_depth: 3
  relationship_types: ["imports", "calls", "inheritance"]
  
# NEW: Graph files always in context  
index:
  always_include:
    - "docs/ARCH_GRAPH.md"    # Human-readable architecture
    - ".graph/ts.json"        # Tree-sitter graph data
    - ".graph/py.dot"         # Python call graph
    - ".graph/js.json"        # JavaScript modules
    - ".graph/metrics.json"   # Performance metrics

# NEW: Graph-aware hooks
hooks:
  post_apply:
    - "pkill -USR1 -f codegraphd"  # Refresh graph after edits
```

### **2. Intelligent Tool Selection**

```javascript
// NEW: Graph-aware tool selection logic
class GraphAwareToolSelector {
  async selectBestTool(query, context) {
    // Analyzes query for structural intent
    // Uses graph to find related files
    // Chooses optimal tool chain
    // Falls back gracefully when graph unavailable
  }
}
```

### **3. Context Enhancement**

Claude now receives rich context about:
- **File relationships** (what imports what)
- **Architectural patterns** (layers, modules, components)
- **Hot paths** (most connected/used code)
- **Dependency health** (cycles, dead code)
- **Recent changes** (what's been modified, impact analysis)

---

## üìä **What Claude "Sees" Now**

### **Before: Individual Files**
```
Claude's context:
- src/auth/login.js (isolated file)
- src/utils/crypto.js (isolated file)  
- src/components/Button.jsx (isolated file)
```

### **After: Rich Graph Context**
```
Claude's enhanced context:
- Architecture Overview:
  * 3 main modules: auth, components, utils
  * 15 hot paths identified
  * 2 circular dependencies detected
  
- File Relationships:
  * src/auth/login.js ‚Üí imports 3 files, used by 7 files
  * src/utils/crypto.js ‚Üí core utility, used by 12 files
  * src/components/Button.jsx ‚Üí base component, extended by 5 others
  
- Current State:
  * Daemon running, 0 errors, 0.3s avg update time
  * Last updated 5 seconds ago
  * 847 total files analyzed
```

## üöÄ **User Experience Transformation**

### **Scenario 1: "Help me refactor the authentication system"**

**OLD CLAUDE:**
- Greps for "auth" across codebase
- Finds 50+ files with "auth" mentions
- User has to manually sort through results

**NEW CLAUDE WITH GRAPH:**
- Analyzes auth module in graph
- Identifies 8 core auth files and their relationships
- Shows dependency chain: login.js ‚Üí auth.js ‚Üí crypto.js
- Suggests refactoring order based on dependencies
- Warns about 3 files that depend on auth for impact analysis

### **Scenario 2: "What happens when I change this function?"**

**OLD CLAUDE:**
- Searches for function name across files
- Limited to text-based analysis

**NEW CLAUDE WITH GRAPH:**
- Traces function through call graph
- Shows exact impact: "This function is called by 7 files"
- Identifies hot paths that would be affected
- Suggests running tests for specific affected modules

### **Scenario 3: "Why is my build slow?"**

**OLD CLAUDE:**
- General advice about build optimization

**NEW CLAUDE WITH GRAPH:**
- Analyzes dependency graph for bottlenecks
- Identifies circular dependencies causing issues
- Shows hot paths that might benefit from code splitting
- Suggests specific files to optimize based on graph centrality

## üîÆ **What This Enables**

With graph intelligence, Claude Code can now:

1. **"Show me the data flow from API to UI"** - Traces through graph layers
2. **"What would break if I delete this file?"** - Impact analysis via dependencies  
3. **"Find all the similar components"** - Pattern recognition in graph structure
4. **"Optimize this slow endpoint"** - Hotpath analysis to find bottlenecks
5. **"Help me split this monolith"** - Module boundary analysis
6. **"What's the most critical code to test?"** - Centrality analysis for test priority

Claude Code transforms from a **smart editor** into a **code intelligence platform** that understands your entire system architecture.
